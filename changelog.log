V0.3
- Added AVR Logger Version
- Added AVR Logger with Hampel filtering
- Added AVR Peak detector with error rejection and automatic scaling

V0.3.1
- Improved Clipping detection in AVR Peak Detector
- Made signal scaling slightly more sensitive to very low amplitude signals
- Increased region-of-interest buffer to prevent overflows that were sometimes generated when scaling very low amplitude signals
- Added RR-interval comparison with previous RR to increase incorrect peak detection. RR difference is not allowed to be larger than 350ms
- Tweaked moving average threshold to allow for larger variation in signal<->noise

V0.4
- Added AVG Logger with automatic amplitude scaling
- Tweaked performance
- Added ARM Logger Version (Teensy boards)
- Added ARM Logger with automatic amplitude scaling
