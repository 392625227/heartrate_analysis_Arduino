# Please check back in a few weeks, currently the repo is in constant state of update. 

## Usable release expected in the week of 16-22 July

# Arduino Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains Arduino IDE implementations of the [*Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit*](https://python-heart-rate-analysis-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Several sketches are available for various AVR (e.g. Arduino) and ARM (e.g. Teensy) chipsets. All implementations have a USB-mode for use in connection with a computer, and an SD-mode that utilised SD-cards to store the data. Suggested wiring diagrams are available for all versions. See the links below for examples of each.
