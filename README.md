# Arduino Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit

This repository contains Arduino IDE implementations of the [*Python Heart Rate Analysis Toolkit*](https://python-heart-rate-analysis-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Several sketches are available for various AVR (e.g. Arduino) and ARM (e.g. Teensy) chipsets. All implementations have a USB-mode for use in connection with a computer, and an SD-mode that utilised SD-cards to store the data. Suggested wiring diagrams are available for all versions. See the links below for examples of each.

**Note**, reports of SD logging interrupting and/or dropping samples have made me move them to "Experimental". I will expect to implement a fix for this within a few weeks.

- Simple logger
- Simple logger with outlier filtering
- Logger with peak position output
- Raw data logger with full functionality

### ARM
- Simple logger
- Simple logger with outlier filtering
- Logger with peak position output
